- [ ] 1. Write a cpp program to create an abstract class - SHAPE to represent any shape in general. The class should have two virtual functions to read dimenstions and to compute the area. Create three derived classes - CIRCLE, RECTANGLE, and SQUARE by inheriting the features of class SHAPE. Implement the functions to read and compute area. Add consturctors, method to display the results as required.(Assume appropriate attributes).
- [ ] 2. Write a cpp program using generic class to implement queue of integers, floating point numbers, and strings. Support queue operations like insert, delete and display in queue class. 
- [x] 3. Write a cpp program to create a vector of integers. Copy the vector contents into a list, sort the contents, then copy selected items into another vector (elements less than 10). 
- [x] 4. Write a template function to search for a given key element from an array. Illustrate how you perform search an integer, character as well as double arrays using the same template function.
- [ ] 5. Design and implement a C++ class POLYNOMIAL. The internal representation of a POLYNOMIAL is an array of terms. Each term contains an exponent and a coefficient. Implement a class containing constructors and the following capabilities:- </br>
a.  Overload the addition operator (+) to add two polynomials </br>
b.  Overload the assignment operator (=) to assign one polynomial to another </br>
c.  Overload the multiplication operator (*) to multiply two polynomials </br>
d.  Overload the >> operator to enable input through in. </br>
e.  Overload the << operator to enable output throughout. </br>
f.  Member function to compute value of polynomial, given the value of x. </br>
